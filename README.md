# Random Number Guessing Game

Try guessing between 1 and 25 to find the random number! 

A random number is generated between 1 and 25 and the player will have 15 tries to guess the random number. A point will be deducted from the current score each time the player guesses the wrong number. A best score is kept if the player wants to continue playing to achieve the highest score.
